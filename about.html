     <p> Candid Rütter is a sound artist and multimedia composer based in Hamburg. His work seeks to explore the chaos of contemporary life, where new realities emerge, intertwine and blur. With roots in club music, Candid is now venturing into a range of media, exploring how they can be orchestrated within a compositional framework. He creates solo pieces and also composes for theatre. Candid studied sound art in Bern and is currently studying multimedia composition in Hamburg.

        In addition to his multimedia compositions, Candid is an active member of several collectives. As part of CRTTR, he co-curates the bi-monthly experimental club music compilation CRTTR-CLB. He is also involved in Prix Garanti, where he produces music and performs as a bassist. <br>
