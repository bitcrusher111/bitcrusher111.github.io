     <p>Candid Rütter is a sound artist and multimedia composer based in Hamburg. His work seeks to explore the 
        chaos of contemporary life, where new realities emerge, intertwine and blur on a daily basis. With roots 
        in club music, Candid is now venturing into a range of media, exploring how they can be 
        orchestrated within a compositional framework. He creates solo pieces and composes music
        for theatre and performance. Candid studied sound art in Bern and is currently studying multimedia 
        composition in Hamburg.

        In addition to his multimedia compositions, Candid is an active member of several collectives. 
        As part of CRTTR, he co-curates the bi-monthly experimental club music compilation 
        CRTTR-CLB. He is also involved in Prix Garanti, where he produces music and performs as a bassist. <br>
