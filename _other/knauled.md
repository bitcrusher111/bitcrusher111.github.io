    The light collectiv Göral and sound designer Candid Rütter have created a 900 metre long vein of light that meanders seemingly aimlessly through the room. It reacts to visitors in real time and transforms the space into an interactive spectacle.  Light pulsates and flickers, sound meets movement and suddenly anything seems possible. Visitors to KNÄULED experience light and sound in a way that was not intended.

    The installation was part of the Lichtfestival Luzern.
