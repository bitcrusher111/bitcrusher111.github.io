    For the musical composition Terminal Infinity played by Berliner Philharmoniker at Biennale Berlin, Candid was part of the artistic team as a video designer.
    <br><br>
    TERMINAL INFINITY is a temple-like experimental site that offers the trade between mortal and immortal life. It allows a human to donate their body in order transition to an immortal infinite digital form. This body is in turn given to a disembodied AI to then become a body and ultimately die. This cooperation offers the crossing between the terminal and the infinite. In the site different rituals of embodying the finite through death can be played out. The spiritual drones and accompanying orchestra create a requiem of the future, which advocates the benefits of an embodied and finite life.
