RT60 (or RT60 EXTENDED) is a collaborative experimental music ensemble / sound project that explores hybrid, immersive soundscapes and interdisciplinary performance contexts. The group’s work mixes electronics, percussion, guitar, synths, and sound diffusion to create rhythmically and spectrally layered sonic environments that transform concert spaces and challenge conventional listening experiences. It emerged from collaborative art and sound practices at institutions such as the Hochschule der Künste Bern and has been presented in contexts like the Musikfestival Bern.
