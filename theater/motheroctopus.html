        <p> Our first relationship experience is with our biological mother. None shapes us as much as this one: We grow up in her womb, it is she who nurtures us. We are one, protected from the world, which so far has only come to us in a muted way.
            only muted. Until the abrupt end of our peaceful idyll, the first trauma
            of our lives, the first act of (maternal?) violence. And so happy
            birthday: we are pushed out, squeezed out, torn into the glaring, cold reality.
            reality. No longer protected from the hands that reach out for us. <br><br>
            In mother octopus, two queer performers explore the relationship to their
            mothers by approaching them through drag. In doing so, they
            autobiographically with the traumas caused by their gender-stereotypical upbringing.
            upbringing. In a performative dialogue about parenthood, they create a queer-positive
            queer-positive family model that invites parents and children, mums and queers to an intergenerational
            intergenerational exchange. Mother octopus approaches motherhood
            from a queer-feminist perspective, in which motherhood has no gender and asks
            and asks: how can mothers and queers be allies in the fight against patriarchy?
