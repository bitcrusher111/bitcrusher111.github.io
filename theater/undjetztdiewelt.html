        <p>
            For play und jetzt: die welt a production by Theater St. Gallen 
            I compose the music. The different pieces of music ranged 
            from auto-tune pop to deconstructed soundscapes. <br><br>
            With the form of my composition I aimed to capture the essence 
            of the postmodern reality of the protagonist (played by Tabea Buser). 
            I deliberately avoided creating a traditional narrative structure 
            within my composition and radically renounced any forms of 
            leitmotifs and repetitions. Instead, I created a series of 
            impulsive, radically different pieces that draw heavily on popular culture. <br><br>
            Each piece reflects the different emotion or aspect of the 
            protagonist's monologue and was partly interpreted directly by her. 
            By using this approach, I tried to draw an analogy to the experience of
            scrolling through an Instagram feed or other social media platform, 
            where content is presented in a seemingly random and disconnected way.
