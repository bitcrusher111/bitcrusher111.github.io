  <p>Where do we feel at home? What do we feel connected to? In a world where the fabric of our reality is permeated by virtual components, these questions appear in an entirely new light.
  FULL CIRCLE weaves together disparate materials, emotional cues, and symbolic references, reflecting the moods that often shape our encounters with digital technologies: longing, dislocation, and transcendence. These states are no longer grounded in physical places, but in mental terrains manufactured through interfaces—simulacra of a reality we yearn for yet cannot reach. FULL CIRCLE is a meditation on these fragile, constructed spaces and on our ongoing search for new forms of connection in a world where permanence and stability are constantly slipping away. <br><br>

  The piece unfolds through a simple, but symbolically rich narrative: A person navigates their fully digitalized sleeping room—a space designed for comfort, optimization, and control. But subtle irregularities begin to surface. Glitches, patterns, fragments of the unfamiliar start to leak through the clean interface of their environment. Drawn to these anomalies, the person embarks on a quiet, intuitive search, slipping into a strange and abstract landscape where the boundaries of reality become increasingly porous.As the familiar disintegrates, the space reveals itself as both a cage and a threshold. What begins as a technological routine unfolds into a metaphysical experience—a portal to an imagined elsewhere.<br><br>

  Valentina Tanni - (Bliss): it is the perfect representation of an inner place, a mental landscape, the field of our imagination and subconscious</p>
