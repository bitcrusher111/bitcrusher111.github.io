  <p>
  Being online means being connected to a greater circuit.  
  Through our daily rituals of consumption and production, we engage in a reciprocal exchange with forces that feel mystical, opaque, and only partially graspable. We feed energy into systems we don´t know, while those systems shape our desires, rhythms, and perceptions in return. Between a defined past and an uncertain future, we remain suspended—trapped in a landscape of endless possibility, where everything appears open and nothing ever arrives.
  <br><br>
  a continuous state of flux follows an allegoric narrativ that unfolds inside this never-ending liminal space. The viewer is led through a fictional experience of total blackout—a sudden incompatibility between subject and technological environment. This rupture triggers an intensified perception of cosmic horror: a confrontation with forces that exceed human scale and comprehension. Trapped within this breakdown, the experience unfolds toward a symbolic death.
