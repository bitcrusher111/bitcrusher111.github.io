<div class="text-container">
  <p>Water is the foundation of all life, yet it is also an immensely destructive force. It shapes the living and the non-living alike. It permeates matter and mind, flowing with quiet persistence as it gradually carves its way forward. Water is a hyperobject: we can perceive only fragments of its totality. <br><br>

  HOLY WATER is a speculative, multimedia ritual that approaches the concept of the hyperobject in an atmospheric and associative manner. In a world in which nature is often treated as a stockpile of resources, HOLY WATER seeks to explore alternative frameworks for relating to the natural world—and, in doing so, to transform our relationship to it. <br><br>

  Using contact microphones attached to a vessel filled with water, the performer is able to set the water itself into vibration. Inside the vessel, a hydrophone captures and amplifies the sounds produced within the water, creating a feedback loop between the performer and the water vessel.</p>
