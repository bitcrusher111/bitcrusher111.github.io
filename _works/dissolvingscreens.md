  Dissolving Screen is an audiovisual installation that examines the relationship between the material surface of screens and the virtual spaces they generate. Through a complex system of video mapping, multiple nested projection planes emerge, continuously shifting between concealment and exposure. At times the projected image dissolves the physical substrate; at others, it renders it distinctly perceptible.
  This treatment of visual material is mirrored in the sound composition, which is spatialized across multiple loudspeakers throughout the room.

  Through this treatment of its media, Dissolving Screen investigates the conditions under which immersion in virtual environments becomes possible, while simultaneously foregrounding the material and perceptual thresholds that such immersion depends upon.
