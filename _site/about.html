        Candid Rütter is a sound artist and multimedia composer. <br><br>
        His musical works usually span several media levels and operate at the intersection of music, theater, and performance. <br><br>
        His compositional approach has been significantly influenced by the practice and aesthetics of club culture. 
        For example, the use of associative sounds and references to create semi-fictional worlds is a central aspect of his compositional work. <br><br>
        In his work, he examines the conditions of life in an ever-expanding, opaque, technological reality. <br><br>
        In addition to his own work, Candid regularly composes music for theater productions, is part of the theater collective INFRAROT, and curates for the music label CRTTR, which focuses on the release of experimental club music. <br><br>
        His artistic career was shaped by his studies in sound arts at the HKB Bern and his current master's degree in multimedia composition at the HFMT Hamburg.
