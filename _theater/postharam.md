  <p>
    We meet in Sirat, the place where, according to Islamic belief, people are held accountable for their actions on earth after death. There it is decided whether people go to heaven or hell. So perhaps this is the only moment when we finally encounter God and the only chance to confront him with what is happening on earth in his name. We bring with us the stories of women who have shared their experiences: of the cruel practices they have endured, all of which are justified by religion. These are accounts from women who had the courage to speak out about their experiences and thereby shake the foundations of a system.
    <br><br>
    But to what extent is misogyny inherent in religion itself, or is it being exploited for this purpose? How can we use the strength of women who repeatedly share their stories to bring about real change? And finally: How do we get out of this sirat!
