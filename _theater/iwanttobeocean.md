  <p>
    'I Want To Be Ocean' presents life cycles that embed and overlap each other in order to complement each other from the indeterminate past into a certain future.
            It works on the identifications of the imagined other, the desiring and adoring, but also the absent, which is reinterpreted through its own power. <br><br>

            'we three<br>
            we three<br>
            i bend for the sake of the existence of us <br>
            we three<br><br>

            in what kind of common we does the I remain - can the I still remain? must perhaps even the I remain so that the we becomes all the more possible? <br><br>

            I I I <br>
            accept my I, me <br>
            so that I, you, your you, your 'I', can also accept it <br>
            create space together for the one yours, your you, mine too ...'<br><br>
        </p>
