    Elisabeth Gärtner no longer wants to live after the death of her husband. The 78-year-old requests a prescription for a lethal medication from her medical officer, Dr Brandt. But the doctor does not want to assist a suicide. She does not think it is right to help a healthy person commit suicide - Mrs Gärtner is not ill and is not suffering from severe pain. In an ethics council, legal, medical and theological experts discuss the case as an example and offer a variety of positions and perspectives on the socially controversial topic of euthanasia. Do people have a right to a self-determined death? Who decides on our death? Who does our life belong to - a god, society, our family or just ourselves?
    <br><br>The lawyer and successful author Ferdinand von Schirach shows the complexity of the topic and forces the audience to rethink their personal stance on the subject through the multi-layered arguments. As with the global success Terror, the audience has the last word in Gott.
    Graubünden director Jonas Bernetta brings the highly topical debate play to the stage in a text version adapted to Swiss circumstances and regulations. Eighty-year-old actress Heidi Maria Glössner can be seen in the role of Elisabeth Gärtner.
