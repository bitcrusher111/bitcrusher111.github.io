  <p>
        For play und jetzt: die welt a production by Theater St. Gallen 
        I compose the music. The different pieces of music ranged 
        from auto-tune pop to deconstructed soundscapes. <br><br>
        With the form of my composition I aimed to capture the essence 
        of the postmodern reality of the protagonist (played by Tabea Buser). 
        I deliberately avoided creating a traditional narrative structure 
        within my composition and radically renounced any forms of 
        leitmotifs and repetitions. Instead, I created a series of 
        impulsive, radically different pieces that draw heavily on popular culture. <br><br>
        Each piece reflects the different emotion or aspect of the 
        protagonist's monologue and was partly interpreted directly by her. 
        By using this approach, I tried to draw an analogy to the experience of
        scrolling through an Instagram feed or other social media platform, 
        where content is presented in a seemingly random and disconnected way.
