            Cassandra, the most beautiful daughter of the king of Troy and priestess of the sun god Apollo. 
            She is doomed to foresee the downfall of her people and her city, 
            but no one believes her prophecies. 
            For three thousand years, her tragic fate has moved our minds. 
            ‘ΕΓΩ ΚΑΣΣΑΝΔΡΑ...’ sets out in search of the essence of a 
            complex and torn character.
