  HARD_BREAK is a collective breakup ritual that combines elements of karaoke, techno clubs, and rage rooms. Breakups are explored as a performative and choreographic practice: the space becomes a walk-in collage of broken movements, repeated loops, collective destruction, and tender reassembly. Starting from romantic separation, the performance opens up a view of larger, necessary breaks: with toxic patterns, neoliberal imperatives, and the longing for the “good old days.”
